<p>
This is the first of three blog posts illustrating Crail's raw storage performance. In part I we cover Crail's DRAM storage tier, part II will be about Crail's NVMe flash storage tier, and part III will be about Crail's metadata performance.

### Hardware Configuration

The specific cluster configuration used for the experiments in this blog:

* Cluster
  * 8 node OpenPower cluster
* Node configuration
  * CPU: 2x OpenPOWER Power8 10-core @2.9Ghz
  * DRAM: 512GB DDR4
  * Network: 1x100Gbit/s Ethernet Mellanox ConnectX-4 EN (RoCE)
             1x100Gbit/s Infiniband Mellanox ConnectX-4 EN
* Software
  * RedHat 7.2 with Linux kernel version 4.10.13
  * Crail 1.0, internal version 2842

### Anatomy of a Crail Data Operation

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
<p>
Data operations in Crail -- such as the reading or writing of files -- are internally composed of metadata operations and actual data transfers. Let's look at a simple Crail application that opens a file and reads the file sequentially:
</p>
</div>
```
CrailConfiguration conf = new CrailConfiguration();
CrailFS fs = CrailFS.newInstance(conf);
//create file without affinity
CrailFile file = fs.lookup(filename).get().asFile();
CrailInputStream stream = file.getDirectInputStream();
while(stream.available() > 0){
    Future<Buffer> future = stream.read(buf);
    //Do something useful
    ...
    //Await completion of operation
    future.get();
}
```
